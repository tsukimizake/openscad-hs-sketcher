-- Module      : Graphics.OpenSCAD
-- Description : Type-checked wrappers for the OpenSCAD primitives.

--
-- = Overview
--
-- The Graphics.OpenSCAD module provides abstract data types for creating
-- OpenSCAD model definitions calls, along with a function to render it
-- as a string, and some utilities. The primary goal is that the output
-- should always be valid OpenSCAD. If you manage to generate OpenSCAD
-- source that causes OpenSCAD to complain, please open an issue.
--
-- The primary effect of this is that Graphics.OpenSCAD distinguishes
-- between 2d and 3d 'Model's. If you want to mix them, you must
-- explicitly convert between them.  While two-dimensional model creation
-- could be polymorphic functions that create either, so that such models
-- could be treated as either 2d or 3d, you'd still have to explicitly
-- convert models whose type was fixed as 2d by a transformation, and
-- 'render' wouldn't work if the type was still ambiguous, ala @render $
-- square 2@.
--
-- = Usage
--
-- Standard usage is to have a @main@ function that looks like:
--
-- @
-- main = draw $ /Solid/
-- @
-- or
-- @
-- main = drawL $ [/Solid/]
-- @
--
-- and then set your IDE's compile command to use @runhaskell@ or
-- equivalent to run your code and send the output to a .scad file. Open
-- that file in OpenSCAD, and set it to automatically reload if the file
-- changes. Recompiling your program will cause the model to be loaded
-- and displayed by OpenSCAD.
--
-- The type constructors are not exported, with functions being exported
-- in their stead.  This allows extra checking to be done on those that
-- need it.  It also provides consistency, as otherwise you'd have to
-- remember whether 'box' is a constructor or a convenience function,
-- etc.
--
-- Because of this, the constructors are not documented, the exported
-- functions are. The documentation is generally just the corresponding
-- OpenSCAD function name, along with the names of the arguments from the
-- OpenSCAD documentation. If no OpenSCAD function name is given, then
-- it's the same as the 'Graphics.OpenSCAD' function. You should check
-- the OpenSCAD documentation for usage information.
--
-- = Oddities
--
-- 'importFile' has been left polymorphic. I couldn't find a sane way to
-- check that you're importing the right file type, so detecting such
-- errors - including importing a 3d file and trying to extrude it - have
-- to be left up to OpenSCAD in any case.  So for now, there's just
-- 'importFile'. This does create the oddity that if you import a file
-- and try and render it without doing something to indicate how many
-- dimensions it has (one of the transformations, an extrusion or
-- projection, or 'solid') you'll get a compile error because the type is
-- ambiguous. Later, this may turn into @import2d@ and @import3d@.
--
-- The interfaces for 'polygon's and 'polyhedron's is seriously different
-- from the OpenSCAD interface. Rather than expecting you to enter a list
-- of points and then references to them, you just enter the points
-- directly. If you really want to do it the OpenSCAD way, you can do
-- something like:
--
-- @
-- draw $ polyhedron [[(p 0, p 1, p 2), (p 0, p 2, p 3), ... ]]
-- where points = [.....]
--       p i = points !! i
-- @
--
-- Also, the OpenSCAD polyedron code recently changed. The old version
-- requires that the faces all be triangles, the new version allows for
-- them to be arbitrary polygons. 'Graphics.OpenSCAD' supports both: if
-- all your faces are triangles, it will use the old version. If some
-- have more points, the new version will be used. If any have fewer than
-- three points you get an error. At this time, no tests are done on the
-- faces. That will probably change in the future.
--
-- Finally, polygon and polyhedron can generate errors on input that
-- seems to generate proper solids. If you turn on 'View->Thrown
-- Together', you'll see it highlighting errors in the object.
--
-- Offset is missing even though it's documented, as it isn't supported
-- by a released version of OpenSCAD, so presumably subject to change. It
-- is implemented, but untested as yet. You can add it to the module's
-- export lists if you want to play with it.
